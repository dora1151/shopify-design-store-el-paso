# Create an Adaptive Navbar Through Liquid Template Programming
As a front-end developer focused on building progressive themes at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), responsive design is a daily endeavor. From navigating on phones to interacting via tablets, the experience shapes how users perceive a brand. Unfortunately, static templates struggle as stores evolve rapidly.

This challenge drove me to integrate Shopify's Liquid framework into new projects. By dynamically querying content sections, components like navigation automatically mirror changes without edits. Store owners need only update in one location, assured rollouts remain consistent.

When building for dynamic e-commerce, rigid structures lose their ability over time. As product lines and pages mature constantly, static interfaces cannot keep pace. Thankfully, Liquid equips developers at Hybrid Web Agency with tools tying interfaces directly into live content sources.

Prime candidates for this approach include core navigational elements. Of all areas, intuitive browsing pathways impact an online journey most. Rather than text links thoughtlessly appended, envision adaptable structures perpetually optimized.

This guide illuminates generating fully responsive, dynamically updating menus using Liquid templating. Readers will gain skills for nesting HTML, querying content, and integrating sections into any theme. Now let's dig into building fluid navigation prepared for limitless growth!


## Structuring the Navbar Blueprint

To begin, we'll build the basic skeleton or "blueprint" of our navbar. Create a new Liquid template called `navbar.liquid` that will hold the dynamic menu markup. 

Within this file, the foundational structure consists of:

```liquid
<nav id="navbar">
  <ul>
  </ul> 
</nav>
```

This defines an outer `<nav>` container with an `id` for styling later. Nested inside is an unordered list `<ul>` that will eventually populate with our navigation links.

For accessibility, links should always reside within a semantic list element rather than loose text fragments. The empty `<ul>` acts as a placeholder for where our generated anchors will output.

Next we need to fetch the actual navigation data from Shopify to power this blueprint. Specifically, we want top-level pages like "Products" or "Blog" stored as global sections. 

Conveniently, Shopify exposes section objects through Liquid. Below the list, embed this data using:

```liquid 
{% raw %}
{% include 'sections' %}
{% endraw %}
```

This pulls in the necessary section definitions. In the next part, we'll loop through these and dynamically insert them into the template skeleton as clickable menu links.


## Animating the Navigation with Dynamic Links

Now that we have laid the structural foundation, it's time to bring motion and fluidity to our navigation. We'll tap into Shopify's section data to automatically populate each menu item.

Within the `navbar.liquid` file, insert this code below the empty list placeholder:

```liquid
{% for section in sections %}

  <li>
    <a href="{{ section.url }}">
      {{ section.title }}
    </a>
  </li>

{% endfor %}
```

This `for` loop cycles through the global `sections` collection, animating each item onto the stage. With every pass, it injects a new list element containing a dynamically generated link.  

The anchor draws its destination from the section URL defined in the admin. Its visible text mirrors the display title for recognition.

By the loop's conclusion, we've orchestrated a fully-fledged menu, its movement and rhythm maintaining sync with backend changes below.

Now our navigation breathes with fluidity, brought to life through dynamic lyrics pulled straight from live content sources. Let's witness its harmonious performance come together in real time through a preview.

The stage is set - it's time for our animated links to dazzle and enthrall.

## Constructing Dynamic Links

It's time to build out the individual navigation items using data from the section objects. Inside the for loop, insert this code:

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}">
    {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

On each pass, this code constructs an `<li>` list item to host a dynamic link. 

An anchor tag nested within receives the `section.url` as its destination attribute. This ensures each link points to the proper page.

The anchor's visible text is set to dynamically output the friendly `section.title`.

And for valid HTML, remember to:

```liquid
  </a>
</li> 
```

Now the loop efficiently assembles a complete navigation, with each item directly mirroring data from the sections. Any changes below are instantly reflected above.

Let's preview how fluidly it brings the backend content to light on the front! The dynamic links spring to action with a refresh.

## Highlight Relevant Navigation

We can make the proper navigation link shine on each page by adding some conditional styling.

Wrap the anchor tag in an `if` statement to single out the matching section:

```liquid
{% if section.id == page.section.id %}
```

This checks if the looped section ID is equivalent to the active section holding the page. 

Apply a class to highlight the relevant selection:

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}" class="highlighted">
   {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

Close out the conditional clause: 

```liquid
{% endif %}
```

Now only the navigation item pertaining to the current page will gleam under the "highlighted" spotlight.

On every request, the related path beams brightly to gently guide shoppers where they need to go. Preview to see the conditional luster in action!

Our navigation systematically spotlights the material pathway through strategic conditional radiance.

## Completing the Navigation Markup

To ensure valid HTML structure for our dynamically-generated navigation, we need to properly close all open tags.

After the loop that outputs each `<li>` element, we should close the containing `<ul>`:

```liquid
</ul>
```

We also need to close each `<li>` at the end of its iteration:

```liquid
  </li>
```

Then when we output the full navigation code, it will have nested lists:

```liquid
<nav>
  <ul>
    {% for section in sections %}

      <li>
        
      </li>

    {% endfor %}
  </ul> 
</nav>
```

By closing all open tags, this structures the HTML semantically as nested unordered lists rather than leaving stray open elements.

Let's check our work by previewing the storefront - the navigation should now display properly with correctly nested and closed list items as intended by the original code. Having valid markup ensures clean rendering and accessibility.


## Include Navbar in Layout

To provide a consistent navigational experience across all site pages, we'll add the navbar code to the shared template layout file.

### Insert Navigation Markup  

We can output the navbar by inserting this liquid tag into the layout header:

```liquid
{{ 'navbar' | liquid }}
```

This will render the `<nav>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` elements we defined for navbar reuse.

### Validate Template Integration

Refreshing a page now allows us to confirm the navigation inheriting as intended throughout common templates. 

The markup should integrate smoothly to routinely guide users between interfaces. With semantics established in the layout, equal accessibility is afforded everywhere online.

Our template design and reusable code come together to deliver accessibility and usability with integrity site-wide. The navigation functions as the essential structural foundation it requires.
